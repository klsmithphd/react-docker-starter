# React Docker Starter (Deprecated)

This project was intended to allow you to get up and running with developing a React application
within a Docker container without installing any dependencies to your host operating
system.

I haven't maintained it since 2016, and I'm sure there are better ways of doing this
these days, and the Dependabot keeps flagging it for outdated dependencies, 
so I'm marking it as deprecated and removing its contents (though leaving the repo
here for its history).
